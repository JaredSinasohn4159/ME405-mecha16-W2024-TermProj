# ME405-mecha16-W2024-TermProj
This project was done as a final project for ME 405 at Cal Poly. The purpose of the project was to create a turret which would incorporate cotasking in order to read thermal signatures, aim a nerf gun, and fire. The turret would then be used to duel other students in a epic battle for extra credit. An image of our project can be seen below:
