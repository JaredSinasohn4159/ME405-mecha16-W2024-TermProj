# ME405-mecha16-W2024-TermProj
This project was done as a final project for ME 405 at Cal Poly. The purpose of the project was to create a turret which would incorporate cotasking in order to read thermal signatures, aim a nerf gun, and fire. The turret would then be used to duel other students in a epic battle for extra credit. An image of our project can be seen below:

  Our design consisted of a 3D printed base. The panning motor slides in to the side and face mounts to secure the position/ tighten the belt. The panning axis was created by a machined aluminum shaft. It has a step down from .75 to .5 inches and was hollowed out to reduce mass. The shaftis supported buy two oil embedded thrust washers. These are both flanged and pressed into the base. This ensured that there was minimal play in the panning axis, the most crtitical for accurate aiming. 36 tooth GT2 pulleys were made in CAD and press fit to both the yaw motor and aluminum shaft.The pitch axis (the uppy downy aim) attaches to the base shaft by the a 3D printed shaft collar. It feature a 1 to 7 gear ratio to drive the pitch. Additionally, the axis features stops so that we can zero off of them for turret startup. We also have a servo which pulls the gun turret.
